# Employee Retention Analysis and Predictive Modeling at Salifort Motors
# Overview
This project aims to address the employee retention challenge at Salifort Motors through data analytics and predictive modeling. The HR department has provided comprehensive employee data, signaling a proactive stance towards improving job satisfaction and retention within the company.

# Business Scenario and Problem
As a data scientist tasked with this challenge, our primary goal is to leverage data analytics to uncover insights and develop solutions that mitigate turnover rates within Salifort Motors. The pivotal question posed by the HR team is centered around identifying the factors that drive employees to leave the organization. Through data analysis and predictive modeling, we aim to discern patterns and correlations within the data that may indicate an employee's likelihood of quitting.

# Objectives
Predict turnover and identify its underlying causes.
Enable proactive retention strategies to reduce turnover rates.
Foster a supportive work environment that promotes long-term employee satisfaction and organizational success.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle: HR Analytics and Job Prediction.
# Description
This dataset contains employee data, including features such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, work accidents, promotion in the last 5 years, departments, and salary level. The target variable is 'left', indicating whether the employee has left the company or not.
# Methodology
Our approach involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, followed by feature engineering and selection to prepare the data for predictive modeling. We will employ machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that can forecast employee turnover and identify key drivers contributing to attrition.

# Project Structure
1. Data: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
